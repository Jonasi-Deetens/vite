## Description

The primary goal of this project is to showcase the integration of Vite, a modern build tool for frontend development, while focusing on creating a custom reusable component within the Vite-powered web application.

## Features

- **Vite Integration:** Utilizes Vite as the build tool for the project.
- **Custom Component Creation:** Demonstrates the process of creating a custom reusable component within the Vite-powered web application.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed before getting started with this project:

- Node.js and npm or yarn
- Basic understanding of JavaScript and web development concepts
- IDE or code editor of your choice

## Getting Started

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:Jonasi-Deetens/vite.git

    yarn dev
    ```

5. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` (or whichever port the bash suggests) to view the project.

## Usage

This project serves as an example of integrating Vite and creating a custom component. Here's how the component implementation is structured:

1. **Vite Configuration:** The project includes Vite's configuration file (`vite.config.js`) with setup tailored for a modern development environment.
2. **Custom Component:** Easily implementable Parallax component which you can use in other projects.

Feel free to explore the codebase, modify the custom component, or integrate it into your projects as needed.
